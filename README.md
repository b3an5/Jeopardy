# Jeopardy

Our application is a three player game based on the popular TV show Jeopardy. This take on the show is a turn based trivia game that gives you four categories with four questions each of varying difficulties. Each question has a point value associated, one random card is a "daily double" in the first round and two in the second round. Round three allows each player to wager there points and answer the same final question. The main learning goals of this project were understanding javascript OOP using ES6 classes and following SRP code development.
